"""The couplings across the language boundary: one value two trees' code must both hold.

One of the three data files `crosscheck.py` reads as a single registry, and all of the data the way
the scan is all of the logic. It was split off `couplings.py` on the seam that file names in its own
first sentence, the vocabulary an entry is written in against the entries themselves, and split
again when the entries here reached the 300-line cap a second time. Nothing in the scan asks which
file an entry sits in, so a coupling moves house without the gate noticing.

What is left here is the kind this file is named for: the body's Rust, the brain's Python and the
overlay's TypeScript holding the same number or the same string where neither toolchain can import
the other's, so nothing but this scan compares them. `shippedcouplings.py` took the entries that
cross a boundary of the same kind that is not a language, where one tree declares a number and a
compose default, a runbook or a module contract restates it, and `endpointcouplings.py` took the
addresses either side answers on, which had grown into more than half of this file. Where a
coupling is both, the question that files it is whether the far side's own code has to hold the
value for the two trees to work together, which is what an endpoint does and what a quoted default
does not.

An ADR is deliberately not among the far sides, on either side of that line. It records what was
decided on a date and must go on saying that after the number moves, where a runbook and a module
contract describe what the tree does now and are wrong the moment it changes.
