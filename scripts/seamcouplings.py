"""The couplings outside the overlay: what the body, the brain, its stack and its runbooks share.

Half of the registry `crosscheck.py` reads, and all of the data the way the scan is all of the
logic. Split off `couplings.py` on the seam that file names in its own first sentence, the
vocabulary an entry is written in against the entries themselves, once the entries here reached the
300-line cap the way the overlay's half had before them. Nothing in the scan asks which file an
entry sits in, so a coupling moves house without the gate noticing.

Two kinds of place live here. Some couplings cross the language boundary the seam is, where the
body's Rust and the brain's Python must hold the same number or the same string and neither
toolchain can import the other's. The rest cross a boundary of the same kind that is not a
language: a default the brain declares once and the compose stack spells again as a shell
substitution, and the runbook that quotes it to an operator as the shipped number. Retuning the
declaration alone leaves every composed deployment running the old one and every reader told the
old one, with nothing saying so, which is the same drift with a different far side.

An ADR is deliberately not among the far sides. It records what was decided on a date and must go
on saying that after the number moves, where a runbook and a module contract describe what the tree
does now and are wrong the moment it changes.
